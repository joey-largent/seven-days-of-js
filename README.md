# seven-days-of-js
The purpose of this self-guided project is to review and practice fundamental JS concepts like conditionals, arrays, objects, functions, dom manipulation and events.

Because I usually spend a lot of time on the design, I will have ai generate simple html and css templates for me (because I am very comfortable in these areas already) so that I can focus entirely on making the app functional. If I have time, I will later come back and make the design my own

The content will be mostly fun and playful so that my daughters can enjoy interacting with them. Since they only speak Turkish, the language of the apps will be in Turkish primarily with a UI switch to English

Day One: Light/Dark Mode + English/Turkish Toggle (for future use)
Day Two: Personalized Funny Greeting Generator
Day Three: Interactive Istanbul Sounds
Day Four: Picture matching game (can change the size of the grid to increase difficulty)
Day Five: Silly Story Generator (you can input who, with who, where, at what time, and what are they doing)
Day Six: a maze where at the end a scary image pops up on the screen with a monster sound
Day Seven: Fortune teller (ask any yes or no question and it generates a random vague answer)
